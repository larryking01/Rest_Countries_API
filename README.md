# Rest Countries API

## Project Description
A responsive Angular application that displays detailed information about countries using the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/). 
It allows users to browse and search for countries by name, filter them by region, view detailed information about each country (including border countries), and switch between light and dark themes. 
It provides a clean UI and maintains a global app state using NgRx.

## üß≠ Routing Overview
Route	                                                            Description
# /	                                                   Home page displaying all countries

# /country-details/:code	                           Details page for a selected country

# **	                                               Wildcard route redirects to 404 page

Routing is configured using Angular's standalone routing system.




## üåê API Consumption
The app consumes the REST Countries API v3.1 to fetch data about all countries.

GET all countries: https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all?fields=name,population,region,capital,subregion,cca3,capital,currencies,languages,flags'

'fields' param is compulsory to specify what part of the country data you want, otherwise the server returns
a bad response.

GET country by code: https://restcountries.com/v3.1/alpha/{code}

API calls are handled in a dedicated CountryApiService.




## üß† NgRx Store Implementation
NgRx is used to manage application state for countries and theme.

# Country State:
* Actions: loadCountries, loadCountryByCode, setSearchQuery, setFilterRegion, selectCountry

* Reducer: Updates state based on loading, error, and filtering conditions

* Effects: Side effects for async API calls (fetching country list and single country)

* Selectors: Retrieve filtered, searched, or selected countries from state



# Theme State:
* Actions: toggleTheme, setTheme

* Reducer: Switches between light and dark modes

* Effects: Persists the selected theme to localStorage and loads it on startup

* Selectors: Retrieve set theme




## üé® Theme Switching Implementation
* User can toggle between light and dark themes using the theme switcher.

* Theme state is managed with NgRx and persisted in localStorage.

* The <body> element is updated with a .dark class to apply appropriate CSS variables.

* CSS uses var(--font-col), --theme-bg, etc., to support both themes.




## üåø Git Workflow
The project uses a simple branching strategy:

main: Production-ready code

development: Active development branch

Changes are committed with meaningful messages and merged using pull requests.
